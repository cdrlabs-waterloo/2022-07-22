Design described in:

    Stangherlin, Kleber, and Zhuanhao Wu and Hiren Patel and Manoj Sachdev.
    "Secure and Lightweight Strong PUF Challenge Obfuscation with Keyed 
    Non-linear FSR.", 2022.

The environment variable `ROOT_DIR` must be defined to the root directory.

Tech specific files were removed. To simulate, you must add APUF and
oscillator models, as well as replace the tech specific cells.

Acronyms are as follows:

    SMP: simple APUF design using LFSR
    NCM: APUF + NLFSR + clock randomizer
    MSK: APUF + NLFSR + Boolean masking
